# CS 111 Final Project
## BYU Fall 2026

This repository hosts a record of my final coding project.

### Project Goals

1. Learn how to simulate a leaky integrate-and-fire model ([[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_neuron_model)]) for a single neuron.

2. Construct a network of $100 \le n \le 1000$ neurons using the small-world model of Watts-Strogatz ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts%E2%80%93Strogatz_model)). Implement the LIF model for this network.

3. Track response variables mean fire rate and synchrony rate while varying the parameters of the small-world network. The hypothesis is that a higher proportion of long connections will lead to an increase in mean fire rate and synchrony across the network.

### Dependencies:

1. `networkx` for network generation.
2. `numpy` for matrix and vector operations.
3. `matplotlib` for visualizations.

### Resources:

1. "Networks", 2E by Mark Newman.
2. "Theoretical Neuroscience: Computational and Mathematical Modeling of Neural Systems," by Peter Dayan and L.F. Abbot.
3. ["Neuronal Dynamics,"](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/index.html) by Wulfram Gerstner et. al.

### To-Do

1. Research methods for implementing single-neuron LIF model.
2. Practice and experiment with one-neuron model, including visualizing mean fire rate and synchrony.

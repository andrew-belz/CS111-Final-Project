    "# Learning to Simulate an LIF Model\n",
    "## November 3, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "The aspect of this project with which I am least familiar is in the numerical simulation of differential equations. Although I am familiar with the theory I have never learned much about numerical methods for solving ODE's. My first goal is to rigorously define what it is I am simulating mathematically, then explore the my resources for the appropriate numerical method.\n",

    "Some numerical methods we could look into using are [**Euler's method**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method) for simplicity or [**RK4**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods) for accuracy.\n",

    "For example, using Euler's method, we choose our total time interval $[0, T_\\text{total}]$, say $1$ second ($1000$ ms). Then we partition $[0, T_\\text{total}]$ into equal discrete intervals of length $\\Delta t$, say $\\Delta t = 0.1$ ms. Then $V(t + \\Delta t) = V(t) + \\Delta t \\cdot \\frac{d}{dt} V(t)$.\n",
